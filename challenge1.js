// 1. Given an array of strings, print only 
// the strings that have exactly 4 characters.

var friends = ["tara", "Steve", "Sam", "Sandra", "Sonny"];
for (i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
if (friends[i].length === 4) {
console.log(friends[i]);
}
};
// Overall goal is to print strings with only 4 letters. 
// Pseudocode: We need to create an array of names (strings) 
// and create a loop to go through the array (list) checking 
// each item (element) and printing out only the ones that 
// have 4 characters. Final solution should print element "tara".
