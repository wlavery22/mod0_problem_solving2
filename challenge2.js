// Start with an array of strings with a mix of uppercase and 
// lowercase letters. Print every word in all lowercase letters.

var friends = ["TaRa", "StEve", "SaM", "SaNdra", "SoNny"]
for (i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
   console.log(friends[i].toLowerCase());
};

// The overall goal for this challenge is to start with a list (array) 
// of words (strings / elements) that have a mix of upper and lowercase 
// letters but print every word in all lowercase letters. 
// Pseudocode: We need a for statement that will loop through the array 
// we create checking each element or string. We need a method that will
// print the entire array in all lowercase letters. The final solution 
// should print all the items in the array with all lowercase letters.
